connecting-REFI-QDA-and-LODcloud

Qualitative research seems rather network-shaped, so why not combine it with LODcloud via its REFI-QDA standard 
... and be able to query the combination? Well, sometimes you don't want your thoughts steered upfront by picking vocabularies. But maybe ...

Some inspiration from semantic web aka Linked Data aka Knowledge Graph:
- relations ... https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-rdf11-primer-20140225/example-graph.jpg
- ... can be embedded in all sorts of documents ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa
- and then queried with an open standard. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL
- Big parts of Wikipedia can be asked questions this way ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBpedia
- ... or actually a giant network or sources of which DBpedia is only one https://lod-cloud.net/
- Many vocabularies are used, many of which are in this list https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov
- DBpedia is trying to fit text into triples, where Wikidata starts with multi-lingual statements from the get-go https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikidata
- Many, many, many tools for entry, analysis, visualisation. At some point there will be atlas.ti-like tools built on this, but in the mean time atlas.ti users can still learn from it
